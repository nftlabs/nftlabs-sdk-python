# Deprecation Notices


## The ``nftlabs-sdk`` package

*As of November 1st, 2021*

> To be removed in ``v1.0.0``

The `nftlabs-sdk` package will be deprecated at the end of 2021. We will
continue to publish versions of the package until then to give folks time
to migrate to the new `thirdweb-sdk` package.

Along with the package name being changes, the sdk type `NftlabsSdk` has also been
renamed to `ThirdwebSdk`. Please switch your usage as soon as you can as the
official `v1.0.0` release will not include the `NftlabsSdk` class.
